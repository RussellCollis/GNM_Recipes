To use this you would have to create your own TeamViewer.pkg recipe, and autopkg repo-add eth-its/autopkg-mac-recipes-yaml.

Alternatively you can copy the PkgPayloadUnpacker directly from https://github.com/eth-its/autopkg/blob/master/Code/autopkglib/PkgPayloadUnpacker.py into /Library/AutoPkg/autopkglib
